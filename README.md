eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis and Modeling

This project involves performing an in-depth analysis and building predictive models based on an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The dataset consists of three files: 
Customers.csv, 
Products.csv, 
and Transactions.csv. 
The tasks covered include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

Project Overview:
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and transaction patterns, build a lookalike model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation to help businesses make data-driven decisions. The steps and deliverables for each task are outlined below:

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
EDA: Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.
Business Insights: Derive actionable insights that can guide business decisions, such as identifying popular products, customer behavior, etc.


Task 2: Lookalike Model
Model Development: Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
Similarity Scoring: Each recommendation will be assigned a similarity score.
Deliverables:
A CSV file mapping the top 3 lookalikes for each customer (C0001 - C0020) with similarity scores.
Jupyter Notebook/Python script explaining the model development and recommendations.


Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Clustering: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on customer profile and transaction data.
Metrics: Evaluate the clustering performance using metrics like DB Index and visualize the clusters using relevant plots.

This project is intended to showcase the application of data science techniques in a business context, including data analysis, machine learning, and clustering. By analyzing customer data, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve business strategy and customer engagement.
